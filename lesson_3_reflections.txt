When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working from more than one computer or collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The branch you have pulled you may be working on for testing purposes and if
so you would not want to continuously have unfinished work be updating with the
remote repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a github 'clone' of someone else's githup repo to one's own github repo. A clone
is a copy from a github account to one's local computer. A branch is a copy of a path from a computer
to the same computer.
