When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working from more than one computer or collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The branch you have pulled you may be working on for testing purposes and if
so you would not want to continuously have unfinished work be updating with the
remote repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a github 'clone' of someone else's githup repo to one's own github repo. A clone
is a copy from a github account to one's local computer. A branch is a copy of a path from a computer
to the same computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Then in case one needs to work offline, one can be sure that the code being worked
on is at least the most recent version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Through email would be one way and it would only be easier in the sense that
email is somewhat universal, but it would be significantly more difficult for version control.
