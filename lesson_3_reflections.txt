When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working from more than one computer or collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The branch you have pulled you may be working on for testing purposes and if
so you would not want to continuously have unfinished work be updating with the
remote repo.
